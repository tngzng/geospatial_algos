def star_house():
    """
    STAR house was notable for many reasons â€”
    it was the first LGBT youth shelter in North America,
    the first trans woman of color-led organization in the US,
    and the first trans sex worker labor organization.

    In the 70s the legal rent for 213 was $310 a month,
    but the owner of the building told Sylvia Rivera and
    Marsha P. Johnson he'd take $200.

    In 2016, a unit in the building sold for $3,399,000.
